##  a.	What would you add to your solution if you had more time?

I would add a detail page when I click the item on the search result.
`
##  b.	If you didn't spend much time on the coding test, then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.
`
I don't have enough time to implement unit tests and e2e tests
`
## 2.	What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.

const fruits = { orange: 1, apple: 10, banana: 4 } 
const { orange, ...rest } = fruits; 
console.log(rest); // { apple: 10, banana: 4 };
```

## 3.	How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
`Honestly, I don't have experience to track down a performance issue in production yet.`
